# fretscale-view
**FretScale** is a visualisation of a guitar's (or a guitar-like instrument's) fretboard. It aims to help learners to identify shapes based on a given root pitch and musical scale/mode.

*This app is currently being migrated into ReactJS.* But a demo of the original version is avalaible at [ABCruz.com](https://www.abcruz.com/media/fretscale-view/).
